//in qs when sw is to be moved and also a certain position index in it as well just apply math
// ->int val=ind%k;(index=original position of that element) and then just iterate all over the loop by just(i++);
//as only unique values (val) we'll get in every sw wit iteration +=k; ez
//this appraoch wil always be optimal as well (for greedy problems)

//but in 2d matrix this ind position would be determined by that particular i,j which would be given in q
